# Test Datasets for NTS Componentisation / General Workflow Gauntlet

# Algorithm Performance Limits
Our gradual pump error dataset
Standard mixes covering one of the following:
- coelution // citric acid?
- gradually increasing mass differences at a similar retention time // possibility to shift RTs
- gradually increasing peak widths
- single standard replicates for very high quality peaks
- some extraction procedure
- contamination with microparticles // assuming the instrument is not damaged by this
- different column age
- Long / short scan times with > 5 replicates each
- Reference standard mix measured by different labs with differing instrumentation

Standards should contain substances relevant to environmental and metabolomics nontarget
If separate standards are produced per field, only vary the matrix
