# Discarded Tests:

## point within maxdist but not within maxdist + 1
The test was removed due to not providing actionable, non-redundant
information. With the addition of a standard-deviation corrected
estimate for the critical distance, potentially interesting outliers
are already covered. The ones which aren't included are represented
through the DQSB.
