  abstract = {This article focuses on the data evaluation of non-target high-resolution LC-MS profiles of water samples. Taking into account multiple technical replicates, the difficulties in peak recognition and the related problems of false positive and false negative findings are systematically demonstrated. On the basis of a combinatorial approach, different models involving sophisticated workflows are evaluated, particularly with regard to the repeatability. In addition, the improvement resulting from data processing was systematically taken into consideration where the recovery of spiked standards emphasized that real peaks of interest were barely or not removed by the derived filter criteria. The comprehensive evaluation included different matrix types spiked with up to 263 analytical standards which were analyzed repeatedly leading to a total number of more than 250 injections that were incorporated in the assessment of different models of data processing. It was found that the analysis of multiple replicates is the key factor as, on the one hand, it provides the option of integrating valuable filters in order to minimize the false positive rate and, on the other hand, allows correcting partially false negative findings occurring during the peak recognition. The developed processing strategies including replicates clearly point to an enhanced data quality since both the repeatability as well as the peak recognition could be considerably improved. As proof of concept, four different matrix types, including a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, were spiked with 130 isotopically labeled standards at different concentration levels. Despite the stringent filter criteria, at 100~ng~L-1 recovery rates of up to 93\% were reached in the positive ionization mode. The proposed model, comprising three technical replicates, filters less than 5\% and 2\% of the standards recognized at 100 and 500~ng~L-1, respectively and thus indicates the general applicability of the presented strategies.},

  abstract = {The behavior of micropollutants in water treatment is an important aspect in terms of water quality. Nontarget screening by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) offers the opportunity to comprehensively assess water treatment processes by comparing the signal heights of all detectable compounds before and after treatment. Without preselection of known target compounds, all accessible information is used to describe changes across processes and thus serves as a measure for the treatment efficiency. In this study, we introduce a novel LC-HRMS data processing strategy for the reliable classification of signals based on the observed fold changes. An approach for filtering detected features was developed and, after parameter adjustment, validated for its recall and precision. As proof of concept, the fate of 411 target compounds in a 0.1 {$\mu$}g/L standard mix was tracked throughout the data processing stages, where 406 targets were successfully recognized and retained during filtering. Potential pitfalls in signal classification were addressed. We found the recursive peak integration to be a key point for the reliable classification of signal changes across a process. For evaluating the repeatability, a combinatorial approach was conducted to verify the consistency of the final outcome using technical replicates of influent and effluent samples taken from an ozonation process during drinking water treatment. The results showed sufficient repeatability and thus emphasized the applicability of nontarget screening for the assessment of water treatment processes. The developed data processing strategies may be transferred to other research fields where sample comparisons are conducted.}

Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) make it possible to identify abnormal process deviations early and assist operators in taking proper action against fault propagation. After decades of development, data-driven process monitoring technologies have gradually attracted attention from process industries. Although many promising FDD methods have been proposed from both academia and industry, challenges remain due to the complex characteristics of industrial data. In this work, classical and recent research on data-driven process monitoring methods is reviewed from the perspective of characterizing and mining industrial data. The implementation framework of data-driven process monitoring methods is first introduced. State of art of process monitoring methods corresponding to common industrial data characteristics are then reviewed. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions for actual industrial applications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Applied sciences have increased focus on omics studies which merge data science with analytical tools. These studies often result in large amounts of data produced and the objective is to generate meaningful interpretations from them. This can sometimes mean combining and integrating different datasets through data fusion techniques. The most strategic course of action when dealing with products of unknown profile is to use exploratory approaches. For omics, this means using untargeted analytical methods and exploratory data analysis techniques. The current study aimed to perform data fusion on untargeted multimodal (negative and positive mode) liquid chromatography--high-resolution mass spectrometry data using multiple factor analysis. The data fusion results were interpreted using agglomerative hierarchical clustering on biplot projections. The study reduced the thousands of spectral signals processed to less than a hundred features (a primary parameter combination of retention time and mass-to-charge ratios, RT\_m/z). The correlations between cluster members (samples and features from) were calculated and the top 10\% highly correlated features were identified for each cluster. These features were then tentatively identified using secondary parameters (drift time, ion mobility constant and collision cross-section values) from the ion mobility spectra. These ion mobility (secondary) parameters can be used for future studies in wine chemical analysis and added to the growing list of annotated chemical signals in applied sciences.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            High-resolution mass spectrometry is widely used in many research fields allowing for accurate mass determinations. In this context, it is pretty standard that high-resolution profile mode mass spectra are reduced to centroided data, which many data processing routines rely on for further evaluation. Yet information on the peak profile quality is not conserved in those approaches; i.e., describing results reliability is almost impossible. Therefore, we overcome this limitation by developing a new statistical parameter called data quality score (DQS). For the DQS calculations, we performed a very fast and robust regression analysis of the individual high-resolution peak profiles and considered error propagation to estimate the uncertainties of the regression coefficients. We successfully validated the new algorithm with the vendor-specific algorithm implemented in               Proteowizard's msConvert               . Moreover, we show that the DQS is a sum parameter associated with centroid accuracy and precision. We also demonstrate the benefit of the new algorithm in nontarget screenings as the DQS prioritizes signals that are not influenced by non-resolved isobaric ions or isotopic fine structures. The algorithm is implemented in Python, R, and Julia programming languages and supports multi- and cross-platform downstream data handling.},

  abstract = {Due to the complexity and volume of data generated through non-target screening (NTS) using chromatographic couplings with high-resolution mass spectrometry, automized processing routines are necessary. The processing routines usually consist of many individual steps that are user-parameter-dependent and, thus, require labor-intensive optimization. Additionally, the effect of variations in raw data quality on the processing results is unclear and not fully understood. Within this work, we present qBinning, a novel algorithm for constructing extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) based on statistical principles and, thus, without the need to set user parameters. Furthermore, we give the user feedback on the specific qualities of the generated EICs using a scoring system (DQSbin). The DQSbin measures reliability as it correlates with the probability of correct classification of masses into EICs and the degree of overlap between different EIC construction algorithms. This work is a big step forward in understanding the behavior of NTS data and increasing the overall transparency in the results of NTS.}

Given the relative novelty of this type of analysis, robust quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures are imperative to ensure quality and consistency of results obtained using different workflows. Due to fundamental differences to established targeted workflows, new or expanded approaches are necessary; for example to minimize the risk of losing potential substances of interest (i.e. false negatives, Type II error). We present an overview of QA/QC techniques for NTA workflows published to date, specifically focusing on the analysis of environmental samples using liquid chromatography coupled to HRMS. From a QA/QC perspective, we discuss methods used for each step of analysis: sample preparation, chromatography, mass spectrometry, and data processing. We then finish with a series of recommendations to improve the quality assurance of NTA workflows.},
